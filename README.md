# GIF Background Remover

This is a modest tool that enables the user to remove the background of a GIF to focus on the topic itself.
It relies on the API of the website remove.bg, thus requires the user to register to this website to get their own API key.
Note that the website offers the processing of about 50 images a month, which makes between two to three simple GIFs.
